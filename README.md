Template on how to add new creative menu groups


Hello To Use This Example Head On Over To The "/item_catalog/crafting_item_catalog.json" file

there you will choose a category to add the group inside and use the template example to add your own items or blocks to the group.

Make sure to remove all the unused groups and unused items.


if you simply want to use one group only. then choose the main file "/item_catalog/crafting_item_catalog.json" 


If you want to see the full .json example you can checkout or rename it to "crafting_item_catalog.json" and edit this larger example file to your liking. 

make sure to rename or remove the original file provided as well.
